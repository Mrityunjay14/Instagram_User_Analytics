# 📊 Instagram User Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing user behavior and engagement on an Instagram-like platform using SQL. By querying user interaction data (likes, posts, hashtags, and sign-up behavior), we derive business insights for marketing campaigns, product development, and investor reporting.
